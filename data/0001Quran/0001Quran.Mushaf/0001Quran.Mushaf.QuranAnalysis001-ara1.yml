90#VERS#COMMENT##: Digital Quran text, downloaded from the
    website https://qurananalysis.com/analysis/full-quran-text.php
    PV converted the text from html, and
    added mARkdown first-level headers for every sura,
    with the sura number and sura name.
    PV tagged every aya as a separate paragraph.
    The original file did not contain pagination;
    PV added a dummy page number under every sura
    (with the sura number as page number)
   NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): All three completed files turned into mARkdown without any change. It might be interesting to know that unlike the two other files, QuranAnalysis001-ara1 does not have bismillah at the beginning of Ayas, which much explain for difference in word numbers.
