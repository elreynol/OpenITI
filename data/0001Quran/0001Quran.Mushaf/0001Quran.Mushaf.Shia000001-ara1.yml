90#VERS#COMMENT##: PV added sura numbers
    and tagged every aya as a separate paragraph.
    He also removed html tags and tildes.
    Aya number are between parentheses at the end of the aya.
   NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): All three completed files turned into mARkdown without any change. It might be interesting to know that unlike the two other files, QuranAnalysis001-ara1 does not have bismillah at the beginning of Ayas, which much explain for difference in word numbers.
