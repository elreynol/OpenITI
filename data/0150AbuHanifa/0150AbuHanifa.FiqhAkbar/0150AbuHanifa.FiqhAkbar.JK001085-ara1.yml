90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: PV
90#VERS#COMMENT##: The creator of this file (JK/Shamela) extracted the
    text of al-Fiqh al-Akbar, ascribed to Abu Hanifa, from a modern sharḥ of
    the text (Muḥammad b. ʿAbd al-Raḥmān al-Khamīs,  al-sharḥ al-muyassir
    ʿalā al-fiqhayn al-absaṭ wa-al-akbar al-mansūbayn li-Abī Ḥanīfa,
    Maktabat al-Furqān),  keeping only Abu Hanifa's text and leaving out the
    commentator's introduction and comments. NB: JK001085 (and
    Shamela0006388) contains both al-Fiqh al-Akbar (pp. 5-72) and al-Fiqh
    al-Awsaṭ (pp. 76-167); while JK006837 (and Shamela006387) contains only
    al-Fiqh al-Awsaṭ (pp. 76-167). For OpenITI, pp. 76-167 were removed from
    JK001085 (and Shamela0006388).
    NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): Deleted redundant METADATA section at the end of the
    text.
