90#AUTH#COMMENT##: EI2: "pioneer Arabic grammarian, the author of a single,
    untitled work, known only as Kitāb Sībawayhi and acknowledged as the founding
    text of Arabic grammatical science. All else, his name, origins, dates and
    originality, is uncertain, Sībawayhi having died too young and too far away from
    the cultural centres of ʿIrāḳ to establish himself in the scholarly biographical
    tradition.": http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1573-3912_islam_COM_1068
