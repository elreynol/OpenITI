90#VERS#COMMENT##: The pages are sometimes marked using an Arabic letter ṣād, but these are not consistent and do not correlate with the official pagination. 
	SPL: The page divisions are erroneous as it appears that page divisions have been inserted between hadith, even if there are multiple hadith on a given page.
	Text appears in good order and closely corresponds to printed edition.
