90#VERS#COMMENT##: The text is in good order and closely corresponds to the
    printed edition. I had to remove a few editorial parts, like footnotes. The
    entire first volume of the printed edition is editorial material. The
    annotations (bāb, kitāb, etc) all appeared at the top of the page rather than
    where they were located in the printed edition. I used the search function to
    replace all the ones I did not do while skimming the text.
