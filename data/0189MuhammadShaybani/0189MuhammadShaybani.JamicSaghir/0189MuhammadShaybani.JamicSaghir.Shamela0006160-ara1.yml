90#VERS#COMMENT##: The text corresponds closely to the printed edition. Although
    the two editions are different they correspond precisely with each other. There
    was some noise which the editor removed, and only one imprecision; the ṣād was
    rendered ḍād on page 464.
   NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): Untagged headers tagged. Levelling of the headers corrected. PARATEXT added.
