90#VERS#COMMENT##: The original digital text contains two separate books:
    Ibn Hishām's reworking of Wahb b. Munabbih's Kitāb al-Tījān
    (0213IbnHisham.Tijan) and another work (0213IbnHisham.AkhbarIbnSarya),
    containing traditions related by the (possibly fictitious)
    ʿUbayd/ʿAbīd Ibn Sharya al-Juhrumī to the Caliph Muʿāwiya,
    that is appended to the Kitāb al-Tījān in some but not all manuscripts.
    Krenkow (Islamic Culture 2.2 (July 1928), p. 234-236) considers the latter
    a separate work (probably) redacted by Ibn Hishām, although Ibn Hishām is not
    mentioned in the riwāya of the work.
    PV split the original text file into two separate files.
