90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: Deleted editorial introduction and table of contents. I have
    also deleted footnote markers but may have missed some. I tagged poetry. The
    text contains identifications of Quran verses (sura + verse number) between
    square brackets. I have left these in place. I have changed the commas in the
    text to Arabic commas. Text does not have a directly obvious structure, so I
    have left everything at first level. Beatrice Gruendler ("The Rice of the Arabic
    Book" p. 137) notes that the text has 114 chapters, but the present version only
    has 96.
    NB: check lines of poetry that seem too short: line numbers 4672
