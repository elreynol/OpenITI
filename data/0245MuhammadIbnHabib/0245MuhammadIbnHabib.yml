90#AUTH#COMMENT##: EI2: "Abū D̲j̲aʿfar , an Arabie philologist of the school of Bag̲h̲dād. Only scant facts of his life are known to us. Ḥabīb ¶ is said to have been the name of his mother, a manumitted slave of the family of Muḥammad b. ʿAbbās b. Muḥammad al-Hāshimī; his nisba of al-Hāshimī is derived from this family whose mawlā he was. However, the Fihrist, and following it, Yāḳūt and al-Suyūṭī, call him Muḥammad b. Ḥabīb b. Umayya b. ʿAmr. The only known date of his life is that of his death on 23 D̲h̲u ’l-Ḥid̲j̲d̲j̲a 245/21 March 860.": http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1573-3912_islam_SIM_5350
