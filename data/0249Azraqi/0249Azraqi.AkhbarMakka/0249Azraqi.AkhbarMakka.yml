90#BOOK#COMMENT##: Sezgin, Geschichte des arabischen Schrifttums 14.347:
    "Abū al-Walīd Muḥammad b. ʿAbd Allāh b. Aḥmad al-Azraqī, a grandson
    of Abū Muḥammad al-Azraqī, reworked his grandfather's work about Mecca,
    including additional tranditions based on sources that mostly belong
    to the period after the creation of the original work. (...)
    Al-Azraqī's book Akhbār Makka al-Musharrafa belongs to the earliest
    works of this type, in which personal biographies did not yet become part
    of the historical geography. Basically, it is a real topography, 
    in the real sense of the word, of Mecca and its surroundings.
    Al-Azraqī probably died around 250/865."
