90#VERS#COMMENT##: 
    NOTE OF THE ANNOTATOR (MAB):
    This text already had structural annotation when I began annotation. I cleaned the text and added to it 
    for the Digital Sira Project. As the aim of the project was to put the text into the Digital Arabic Reader (DAR),
    I added additional headers to aid navigation of long sections (but only for sections prior to the death of the Prophet)
    The Shamela metadata states that this text is based on the Beirut edition. I was unable to consult this edition, but 
    the pagination matches the Cairo Dar al-Macrif edition (full ref in worldcat permalink) and I believe the Beirut edition
    is a reprint of this. 
        Summary of key changes:
        1 - removed page headers from middle of text (e.g. سن 281), 
        2- Added more subheadings headings based on divisions used by the Leiden edition (to ease navigation in DAR).
        3 - Added more subheadings based on consultation with the Tabari translation (to ease navigation in DAR).
        4 - Removed headings marked /### === (headings added by shamela) or turned them into mARkdown headings placing heading between [] to
            indicate it was added by shamela.
   NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): 1- The first-level headers for volumes removed and all headers moved up by one level. 2- Major changes in levelling of the headers made, mostly in the first two volumes. 3- Two titles in PageV01P009 and PageV01P032 broken to make the structure clearer. 4- PARATEXT added. 5- The annotator has separated the sub-chapters by blank header tags. Since blank headers does not tell us anything about the structure, titles should be added here in square brackets. 6- Another edition of the text is accessible here: https://archive.org/details/1879p.d.f1709
