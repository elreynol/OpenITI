90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Mathew Barber
90#VERS#COMMENT##:
    NOTE OF THE ANNOTATOR (MAB):
    This text already had structural annotation when I began annotation. I cleaned
    the text and added to it
    for the Digital Sira Project. As the aim of the project was to put the text into
    the Digital Arabic Reader (DAR),
    I added additional headers to aid navigation of long sections (but only for
    sections prior to the death of the Prophet)
    The Shamela metadata states that this text is based on the Beirut edition. I was
    unable to consult this edition, but
    the pagination matches the Cairo Dar al-Macarif edition (full ref in worldcat
    permalink) and I believe the Beirut edition
    is a reprint of this.
    Summary of key changes:
    1 - removed page headers from middle of text (e.g. سن 281),
    2 - Added more subheadings headings based on divisions used by the Leiden
    edition
    (to ease navigation in DAR).
    3 - Added more subheadings based on consultation with the Tabari translation (to
    ease navigation in DAR).
    4 - Removed headings marked /### === (headings added by shamela) or turned them
    into mARkdown headings placing heading between [] to
    indicate it was added by shamela.
    NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH):
    1- The first-level headers for volumes removed and
    all headers moved up by one level.
    2- Major changes in levelling of the headers
    made, mostly in the first two volumes.
    3- Two titles in PageV01P009 and
    PageV01P032 broken to make the structure clearer.
    4- PARATEXT added.
    5- The annotator has separated the sub-chapters by blank header tags. Since
    blank
    headers does not tell us anything about the structure, titles should be added
    here in square brackets.
    6- Another edition of the text is accessible here:
    https://archive.org/details/1879p.d.f1709
    PV: Further cleaning done by PV and HRH:
    1- continuation of paragraphs after page numbers indicated with "~~"
    2- removed traces of original encoding and html tags
    3- tried to make sure all isnāds are starting on a new paragraph
    (if they indeed do start a new paragraph)
    4- added PARATEXT marker for volume information and basmallah
    5- converted "..." into "%~%" poetry tags.
    Remaining problems, noted during the cleaning process:
    1- new paragraphs are not always indicated with a hashtag
    (PV only consistently fixed the cases where a paragraph
    starts with qāla Abu Jaʿfar, wa-fīhā or wa-fī hādhihi al-sana;
    there are definitely other cases remaining where a new paragraph is not tagged).
    Also, many paragraphs are split into multiple parts by hashtags
    that should not be there (especially after a colon).
    2- some poetry is not tagged as poetry (especially when only a half verse
    is quoted, but sometimes also longer segments of poetry are not tagged;
    PV fixed those he came across, but there must be cases remaining)
    3- the edition contains a number of untitled sections
    (indicated in the printed edition, but not the digital text, with "* * *");
    these usually mark the transition from one topic to another.
    PV has tried to add these as blank `### || ` headers as he came across such
    cases,
    and more consistently for vol. 1 pp. 1-216,
    but has not gone through all volumes to add those markers.
    It must be noted that these untitled sections are not
    consistently inserted in the printed edition.
    4- The structural tagging of sections and subsections needs more work.
