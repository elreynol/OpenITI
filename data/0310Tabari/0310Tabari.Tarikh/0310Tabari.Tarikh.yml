    The editor of this text explains that he has used the Leiden
    edition (de Goeje et al) as the base, but has used manuscripts
    that were not used by de Goeje et al, mentioning the differences
    of manuscripts in the margin of the pages
    (see the editor’s introduction, pages 27 ff).
    The Leiden edition is accessible here
