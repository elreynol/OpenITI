90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: PV
90#VERS#COMMENT##: The introduction is different from the collated edition, but
    the text (and pagination) of the body is identical.
    The digital text was missing the last three pages; PV typed them up.
    PV tagged the editorial introduction and the paratext at the end,
    and removed a number of incorrect tags at the start of citations.
    NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): No changes.
