90#BOOK#COMMENT##: Earliest geographical work that takes Mecca
    as its centre. It mentions places based on their qibla position,
    but takes the form of a historical geography (GAS 14.205).
    The book is not extant in its original form,
    but only in two seperate abreviations, each probably based
    on a different redaction (see GAS 14.206):
    - version 1 (based on redaction of 318/930):
    * London, British Library, ms. Or. 133315 (2a-57b)
    - version 2 (bsed on redaction of 332/943):
    * Cairo, Dār al-Kutub, ms. Taymur 103 buldān
    * Istanbul, Veliyüddin ms. 2453/2 (47a-169a)
    The Baghdād edition is based on (a microfilm of) the Cairo ms.
    (see introduction to the edition, p. 89-90).
