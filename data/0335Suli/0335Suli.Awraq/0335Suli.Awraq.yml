    Only fragments of this book are extant, 
    in four manuscripts (see introduction to Heyworth Dunne's edition, p. ḥā';
    and the Arabic introduction to Belyaev's edition, p. 304):
    1. Cairo, Dār al-Kutub ms Tārīkh 594: 
       fragment on the modern (muḥdath) poets.
       Edited by Heyworth Dunne in 1934 (0335Suli.AkhbarShucara);
       this manuscript is now in bad condition but a copy
       was made of it in 1249AH by Muḥammad ʿAbd Allāh al-Zamrānī
       and is now in Maktabat al-Azhar in the Abāẓa collection.
    2. Istanbul, Sulaymaniye ms Shahid Ali 2141: 
       * fragment on the poetry of the sons of the ʿAbbāsid caliphs
       * fragment on al-Rāḍī (r. 322-329/934-940) and al-Muttaqī (r. 329-333/940-944).
       Both fragments were edited by Heyworth Dunne in 1935-1936
       (0335Suli.AshcarAwladKhulafa and 0335Suli.AkhbarRadi).
    3. Cairo, Maktabat al-Azhar, ms 487 Khāṣṣ - 7083 Abāẓa Adab
       (according to Belyaev: Tārīkh 6737 or Tārīkh 443): 
       fragment covering the years 295-318AH 
       (end of the reign of al-Muktafī (r. 289-295),
       and reign of al-Muqtadir (r. 295-220));
       Heyworth Dunne planned to publish it in the year 1937, 
       but the edition never appeared. 
       Hilāl ibn Nājī edited it in two parts
       (0335Suli.MaLamYunshar and 0335Suli.QitcaNadira)
    4. St Petersburg, National Library, ms Khanikof 60 
       (copied in 506 AH by Aḥmad b. ʿAlī b. Muḥammad al-Dāmghānī).
       Fragment on the reigns of al-Wāthiq (r. 227-232),
       al-Mutawakkil (r. 232-247), al-Muntaṣir (r. 247-248), 
       al-Mustaʿīn (r. 248-252), al-Muʿtazz (r. 252-255) and al-Muhtadī (r. 255-256).
       This manuscript was edited by Kratchkovsky's student Belyaev (d. 1976)
       but never published; finally, Belyaev's student Anas Khalidov published it,
       with a Russian translation, in 1993.
    There are a number of other manuscripts of parts of the text,
    but they all seem to be modern copies of one of the above manuscripts
    (incl. a manuscript in Astana, of which a photocopy exists 
    in Cairo, Dār al-Kutub 3530).
    The work had a historical and a poetical component;
    Khalidov thinks it is possible that the two poetical parts that have been edited
    are all that al-Ṣuli had written of the poetical component;
    but of the historical component, only three out of ten parts may be extant,
    judging from Ibn al-Nadīm's description of the work (Khalidov edition p. 303).
