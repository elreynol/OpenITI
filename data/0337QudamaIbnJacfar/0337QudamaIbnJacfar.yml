D̲j̲aʿfar al-Kātib al-Bag̲h̲dādī , Abu ’l-Farad̲j̲ , philologist, historian, and one of the first scholars to introduce the systematic study of the figures of speech in Arabic literature. The date of his birth is nowhere mentioned and may have been as early as around the year 260/873-4. He died at an uncertain date which is variously given as “during the reign of al-Muḳtadir” (i.e. not later than 320/932), 328/939-40, and 337/948.": http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1573-3912_islam_SIM_4478
