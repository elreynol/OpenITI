90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: SPL (CnC)
90#VERS#COMMENT##: I could not find the edition it is purported to be in the
    metadata on Worldcat.
    However, compared with other online editions (e.g.,
    https://ketabonline.com/ar/books/12297/read),
    it appears to be complete. Pagination has failed. Cleaned up auto tagging.
    The CnC bibliographies mentions the edition with a commentary by al-NasafÄ«
    but there is no PDF version available.
    I assume this is a reconstructed text,
    so it appears the only original part is the final section which includes the
    'Usuls',
    but as I cannot compare it to a printed edition, I have kept the editorial
    sections.
