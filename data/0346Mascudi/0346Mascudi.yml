90#AUTH#COMMENT##: EI2: "Abu ’l-Ḥasan ʿAlī b. al-Ḥusayn , Arab writer whose
    activity, in the words of Brockelmann (in EI 1, s.v.) “has been undertaken
    outside the well-trodden paths of professional scholarship”. Al-MascudI was born
    in Baghdad into a Kufan family which traced back its generalogy and connected
    its nisba to the Companion Ibn Mascud [q. v. ]. He himself does not record his
    ancestry in entirety, but it could well be as follows: CA1I b. al-Husayn b. CA1I
    b. cAbd Allah (M, § 522) b. Zayd b. cUtba b. cAbd al-Rahman b. cAbd Allah b.
    Mascud. he must have been born no later than some years before 280/893, and not
    ca. 283/896, as is suggested by A. Shboul":
