90#VERS#COMMENT##: Text was pretagged and of good quality. Pagination appears to
    be fine. I tagged the poetry (though may have missed some half lines). I
    have
    deleted footnote markers. Textual hierarchy is not very evident from the
    headers, so I have divided according to the logic suggested in Julia Bray's
    article "Al-Amidi's al-Muwazana and the size of knowledge" (Journal of
    Abbasid
    Studies 2020), and where I could infer that a hierarchy was meant. Much of
    this
    is quite tentative, as it would require a close reading, and even then
    things
    are not very clear (see Bray's article). I have deleted some superfluous
    titles
    in volume 2, which are not in the pdf.
