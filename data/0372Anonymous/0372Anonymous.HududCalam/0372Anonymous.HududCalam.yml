90#BOOK#COMMENT##: One of the earliest extant works written in new Persian,
    as it was composed in 372/982 and dedicated to the Fārighūnid amīr
    Abū al-Ḥārith Muhammad of Jūzjān; it is not clear if it was a translation
    of an Arabic original or was directly written in Persian.
    The unique manuscript was copied in 656/1258 and forms part of a majmūʿ
    manuscript with three other texts. See GAS 14.233f. and
    Bosworth's translation of Barthold's edition of the text.
