90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: Manual transcription of MS Bibliothèque nationale de France
    Arabe 2309 folios 115b-122b, an early but highly variant attestation of material
    also found in 0375IkhwanSafa.RisalatJamicatJamica. Transcription is rough for
    OpenITI/passim purposes and contains several tentative readings of rather
    technical terminology, this should not be considered a definitive edition.
   NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): I added the REVIEW_NEEDED label. I think it’s better that the text is reviewed by a specialist bacause the OCR is incorrected as the annotator mentions and also for the technical terminology and maybe the authorship.
