90#VERS#COMMENT##: The text has been tagged before; no proper YML file
    yet.
    NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): Pages 117-161 are missing; most probably because it
    is mainly in Persian and is omitted intentionally by the typist. However, this
    part should be added, not just to have a complete version of the text, but also
    because the last pages are in Arabic and contain biographical entries again.
