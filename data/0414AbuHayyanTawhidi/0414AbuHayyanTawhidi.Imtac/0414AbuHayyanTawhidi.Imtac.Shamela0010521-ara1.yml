90#VERS#COMMENT##: Deleted editorial sections and footnotes, tagged poetry. The text is divided into three parts which appears to be inherited from the original text (every volume has a separate introduction), so I have left the division in place. The edition used here is the one circulating most widely online, seems to be a reprint of the Amin & Zayn edition. 
   NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): The editorial section in PageV01P159 removed. The header in PageV01P404 turned from third-level into second-level.
