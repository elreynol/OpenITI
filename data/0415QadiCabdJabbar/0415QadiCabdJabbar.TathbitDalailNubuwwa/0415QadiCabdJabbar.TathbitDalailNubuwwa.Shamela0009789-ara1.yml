90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: AQ; Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: Automatic tagging was based on the table of content
    created by the editor, so I had to remove many arbitrary headings Apart
    from that the editor has added headings within [] to the chapter
    headings (bƒÅbs), those are kept. The URI should be changed as I have
    suggested already to "0415QadiCabdJabbar" 
 Gowaart: deleted editorial sections, footnote markers and forward slashes which were still present. URI has been changed already. I also deleted the volume headers, as these are clearly editorial, the text is not meaningfully divided into volumes. I tagged the poetry where I could find it easily (either there isn't much poetry in the text, or the majority hadn't been formatted as poetry). Pagination seems correct.
