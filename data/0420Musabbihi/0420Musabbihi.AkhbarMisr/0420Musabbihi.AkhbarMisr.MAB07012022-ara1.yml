90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Mathew Barber
90#VERS#COMMENT##: OCRed through Kraken:
    * Kraken version: 3.0.0.0b21.dev6
    * segmentation model: DEFAULT
    * OCR model: 04-01-2021_ArabPersGeneralized.mlmodel
    * Added annotation
    * Minor corrections to OCR - there will be cases where I have missed
    mistranscriptions and so some errors will remain.
    * Removed editor's introduction
    * Removed footnotes
    * Corrected pagination
    * Where two words are close together in the print they are sometimes elided -
    attempted to add spaces where I have spotted  this
    * Occasionall missing characters on the starts of lines
    * Spaces in middle of words at starts of lines - fixed where I have spotted this
    * Random chars - usually colons ':' - at ends of lines, produced by artefacts on
    the pages
    * Where multiple poems quoted on one page with different indentation -
    transcription is very messy - resulting from poor line segmentation - these
    instances have been corrected
    * At the end of the work there are two collections of excerpts of al-Musabbihi's
    text from al-Maqrizi's Itticaz and Khitat added by the editor. These have been
    removed in this version.
