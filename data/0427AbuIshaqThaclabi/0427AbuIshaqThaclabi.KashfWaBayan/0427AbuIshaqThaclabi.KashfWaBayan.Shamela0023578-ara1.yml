90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: HRH; Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: All the Quranic verses were omitted in Vol 4 (and I
    put a first-level header tag to mark their beginning, in conformity with
    other volumes). Gowaart added them by copying them from the
    Shia002529Vols file which did include them. They have * separating the verses,
    which he has left in place.
    The first paragraph in vol. 7 page 188 is also missing. Gowaart added this
    page from Shia002529Vols. There were several more such instances,
    always the introductory remarks for the sura.  Gowaart has not restored
    this section from Shia002529Vols as this is in fact
    an editorial addition of opinions by other exegetes on the topic
    (it is present in the Shia file however and may be recuperated there if so
    desired,
    though Gowaart would argue against it).
    In Vol 8, pages 37-41 are missing.
    Some very minor inaccuracies in the text like “فأنزلنا” instead of
    “فأنزل” in Vol. 1 P. 202 Line 14 and “ويربي” instead of “ویزکی” in Vol.
    2 P. 383 Line 20.
    Note of the reviewer (Gowaart):
    Deleted editorial sections, added paratext for first paragraph.
    Deleted footnote markers, manuscript page markers and html tags.
    There was some overtagging of lines as poetry that were not actually poetry,
    I have corrected many of these.
    I have also made rather extensive changes to the header leveling.
    For the first two suras the actual tafsir of verses has been set apart
    from other info given related to the sura. To make the text consistent,
    I have added an extra second level header for all of the other suras,
    following its introductory remarks.
    A specific computational comparison of these two versions may be desirable to
    check
    whether any other sections may be missing.
