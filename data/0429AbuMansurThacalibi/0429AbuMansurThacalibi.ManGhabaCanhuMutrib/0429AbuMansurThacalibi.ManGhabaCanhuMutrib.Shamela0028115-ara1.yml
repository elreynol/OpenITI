90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: Both versions seem to be based on the late 19th
    century edition linked here (which could not be found on Worldcat). I
    used the primary version which also already included pre-tagging.
    Cleaned up several wrong headers and put two that were added by the
    typist in square brackets (as they do make structural sense).  Both
    versions are missing the text's short introduction which is not
    editorial but part of the original text. I orignally transcribed it into
    the file but have now taken it out and pasted it below in this comment.
    There are more recent editions of this text, and considering the absence
    of this introduction in the typed version I would suggest adding an
    improved version to the corpus.
   NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): NO changes. I just added the paragraph typed by the annotator in the yml file to the text (Although the text is an old edition, it seems to have a good quality. A higher-quality edition can be added in a separate file). 2- A different edition is accessible here: https://archive.org/details/Heliopolis1957_gmail_20181016_2236
