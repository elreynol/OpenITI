90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: Originally annotated by unknown, validated by
    Gowaart. Structure was left intact but I have made the headers more
    consistent (this was done to better extract the headers from the file
    for personal research purposes, but also improves the quality of the
    digital text).
   NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): The idea of the book is to explain about words,
    phrases, proverbs, and names that were used as famous sayings in Arabic literary
    context. So, the numbers are lexical entries, not headers, and therefore I
    changed their tag from second-level headers to simplified tag for lexical
    entries: ### $. 2- A few untagged headers tagged. Removed PageV01P297-8 and
    PageV01P597 which were duplicate.
