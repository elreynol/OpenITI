   NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): I deleted the tags for second and third- level headers since they are all part of sentences and cannot be tagged as headers. I also changed the tag for the two appendixes to PARATEXT since their authors seems to be premodern, although I couldn’t find any information about them. If they have identity, it’s better to split off their parts under their own names.
