90#VERS#COMMENT##: Removed some footnotes; random chars. Tagged hadiths via
    Regex as they followed, thankfully, a variety of patterns. Vols 6 and 9 are
    missing in the PDFs; but as
    the numbered entries were fully represented (i.e., no missing numbers/entries),
    they are highly likely to reflect the printed editions.
    Vol 10 had some additional material, not in the printed edition, which has been
    removed (these sections were introduced by a hyperlinks).
