    al-ʿUdhrī "wrote a large book on geography with a tendency for mirabilia
    under the title Tarṣīʿ al-akhbār wa-tanwīʿ al-āthār wa-al-bustān fī gharā'ib al-buldān
    wa-al-masālik ilā jamīʿ al-mamālik. From this book, which was often used by later 
    geographers like al-Idrīsī, Yāqūt and al-Qazwīnī, only the part on Andalusia
    is extant."
