90#VERS#COMMENT##: Could not locate a pdf of edition used for the
    digital text (it seems to be a popular printing), so used the Dar al-
    Kutub version instead. Neither of these editions is on Worldcat. Text is
    broadly similar, and structure is mostly identical. However, the Dar al-
    Kutub version is still different: for example it includes eight sections
    between pp. 269-290 (these would be inserted between lines 2620-2621)
    which are entirely absent from the digital text. Other smaller
    differences which I have seen in the text indicate that this may  be due
    to divergent manuscript traditions. Where untagged titles in the digital
    text have the same wording as titles in the Dar al-Kutub  edition I have
    included them in the structure tags, but not where their wording is
    different. I inserted mARkdown tags for poetry through regex.
    NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): The first chapter (al-madkhal) is not written by
    the original author. It is written by the collector of the text (about whom
    see
    introduction, page22). So I removed the first-level tag for it and replace
    it
    with PARATEXT. 2- As this collector explains (and is written on the cover
    page
    of the PDF), the text is a collection of two books: “الظرائف واللطائف” and
    “اليواقيت في بعض المواقيت”. So, these texts should be separated into two
    files.
    I raised an issue for this. However, it is not clear from the structure
    where
    the second text begins, and I couldn’t understand this. Someone must read
    the
    text and its introduction closely. 3- This link is a PDF of the same edition
    as
    the digital version. It leads you to a payment-based website and you must
    have
    an account to see the PDF:
    https://www.noorlib.ir/View/fa/Book/BookView/Image/3584; A different old
    edition
    of the text is also accessible here: https://archive.org/details/999Pdf
    NB: check lines of poetry that seem too long: line numbers 1590
