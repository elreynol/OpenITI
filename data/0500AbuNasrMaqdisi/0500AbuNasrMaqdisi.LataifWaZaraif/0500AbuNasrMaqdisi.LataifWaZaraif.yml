90#BOOK#COMMENT##: This book is the work of a compiler who
    combined two books by al-Thaʿālibī
    (K. al-Ẓarā'if wa-al-Laṭā'if and K. al-Yawāqīt fī baʿḍ al-mawāqīt)
    into one work.
    Nāṣir Muḥammadī Muḥammad Jād, editor of the 2009 edition,
    (https://archive.org/details/zad27/page/n25/mode/2up)
    tries to identify this compiler, Abū Naṣr al-Maqdisī,
    but does not manage to identify him exactly;
    he comes to the conclusion he probably died
    in the late 5th C AH.
    There seems to be no real title for the compound work -
    the extant manuscripts have either the title of both
    of Thaʿālibī's books, or only K. al-Ẓarā'if wa-al-Laṭā'if
    (see the introduction to the same edition).
