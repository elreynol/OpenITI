    "[al-Marwazī's] apparently enyclopaedical Kitāb ṭabā'iʿ al-ḥayawān, which is extant
    in two incomplete manuscripts, contains an important geographical part. 
    V. Minorsky has researchd it, translated it into English and edited it in 1942. 
    In his opinion, the text is extraordinary: the chapter on China contains a unique
    report about the embassy sent by the ruler of Kitan (northern China)
    to Sultān Maḥmud, the conqueror of India (1027 AD). (...) One can say without
    exaggeration that there is almost no chapter by al-Marwazī that does not contain
    new information or reports."
