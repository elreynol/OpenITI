    "Sharaf al-Zamān Ṭāhir al-Marwazī probably came from Marw
    and was a physician at the court of the Seljuk sultan Malikshāh
    (r. 465-485/1072-1092). According to his own account, he was 
    10 years old in the year 448/1056, which means he was born in 438/1046.
    He reports about an ant plague in the year 514/1120; 
    that is all we know about him."
