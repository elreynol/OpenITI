90#BOOK#COMMENT##: Sezgin, Geschichte des arabischen Schrifttums 14.265-267:
    al-Zuhrī "has reworked the
    the geography that about 70 scholars had created for the caliph al-Ma'mun,
    ca. 300 year earlier, and which was available to him in the Geography of
    a certain al-Fazārī. (...) It is difficult to define the relationship
    between the extant work of Abu ʿAbd Allāh al-Zuhrī and the Geography of
    al-Ma'mun's geographers. It is neither an extract, nor a revision in the
    real sense of the word. Looking at the entire book and the author's way 
    of citation gives the impression that he wanted to create a compilation,
    based in the first place on the Ma'mun work. He did not have a special
    sense for uniformity in relation to the selection of his sources and the
    material he took from them, but he does display a conspicuous inclination
    to mirabilia. In any case, it is hard to say what he took over from the
    work of al-Ma'mun's geographers."
