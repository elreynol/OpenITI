    NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): Missing lines reported by the annotator typed and
    redundant parts removed. Headers that were tagged incompletely corrected. 2-
    Chapter 35 include a list of names without any explanation. Maybe it’s better to
    remove the ### $ tag for the names. However, I did not do that since they might
    be helpful. 3- Other editions are accessible:
