90#VERS#COMMENT##: Could not find the exact edition used here so I collated with
    the one  circulating online. It appears that the manuscript has no headers at
    all, so the ones in this digital text and the ones in the pdf often do not agree
    and generally don't look like classical Arabic headers. They must be editorial
    additions, so I have put all of them between square brackets. The text otherwise
    appears to be of good quality. I have marked only one second level header. I
    have tagged poetry.
    NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): I found the PDF of the same edition and collated it
    with the digital version and made changes in the headers and their levelling. 2-
    As the editor explains in the footnote of page 1, All the headers are his
    insertions and the manuscript does not have headers except two in pages 114,
    169. In some cases, the typist has removed some of these editorial headers and
    inserted new ones. So, the headers in the PDF and in the digital version are not
    necessarily the same. 3- Part of page 226 and page 227 are missing. They can be
    copied from JK9309 which is a reprint. 4- Find a different edition of the text
