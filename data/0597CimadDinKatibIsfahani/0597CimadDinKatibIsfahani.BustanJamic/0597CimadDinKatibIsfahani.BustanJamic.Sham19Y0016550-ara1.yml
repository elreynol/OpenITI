90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: Editorial material and footnotes deleted. Text is of good
    quality. Structure is straightforward, it consists basically of annals which are
    second level headers, with some rubrication of periods by the editor which are
    first level. The authorship of the text is likely dubious, however, so this may
    need to be revised at some point.
    NB: check lines of poetry that seem too long: line numbers 1306
   NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): I deleted a lot of headers that were duplicates in wrong places, and tagged the untagged headers in their correct places. 2. There is a first-level header in PageV01P242 that does not exist in the PDF, showing the beginning of the reign of Ikhshidid ruler Abu al-Misk Kafur. Since Kafur died ion 356 according to the text (PageV01P242), I added another first-level header after this year to show that the rest of the text is not about him. Besides, there was a header in PageV01P175 showing the beginning of the reign of the Abbasid ruler al-Maâ€™mun. I untagged this header because firstly it is in the middle of the body text, and secondly his reign begins several years before this time.
