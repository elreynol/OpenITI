90#BOOK#COMMENT##: According to al-Masʿūdī's introduction to his Murūj al-
    dhahab,
    Akhbār al-Zamān was his earliest book on history and geography,
    and Pellat thinks it may have taken the form of an annalistic work (EI2 s.v.
    "al-Masʿūdī").
    Charles Pellat writes in EI2 s.v. "al-Masʿūdī": "The K. Akhbār al-zamān
    published in Cairo, in 1938, by Ṣāwī, has nothing in
    common with that of al-Masʿūdī."
    Michael Cooperson (https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/masudi)
    agrees: "A work under this title has been published,
    but it is far too abbreviated and far too divergent in style
    from the Moruj and the Tanbih to be considered authentic.
    Its author may nevertheless have had access to now-lost works by Masʿudi."
