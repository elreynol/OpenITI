90#VERS#COMMENT##: The tag ### $ is used as a simplified tag for toponyms (these toponyms are mentioned to name the famous people buried in). 2- In a few cases, these toponyms are inside the text and should not be tagged structurally, but they had automatic tags and I kept these automatic tags, since they were in correct places.
