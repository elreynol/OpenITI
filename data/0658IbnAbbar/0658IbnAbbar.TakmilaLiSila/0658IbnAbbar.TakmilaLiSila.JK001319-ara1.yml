90#VERS#COMMENT##: PDF almost exact match. Some parts are missing in the
    text. The numbering of the biographies sometimes confused in the PDF
    (and the text). Some numbers are missing - Vol1, 46; Vol2, 280; Vol3,
    515; Vol4, 95-97, 150-158, 447;  some numbers doubled - Vol2, 476, 496,
    525. Some biographies of the PDF are missing in the text - Vol1,
    1309-1325; Vol3, 630; Vol4, 483-485, 502-504. More information needs to
    be added during vetting (PDFs are in the repository)
    NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): PARATEXT added. Editorial removed. Levelling of the
    headers corrected. Womenâ€™s biographies tagged. 2- I checked the numbers reported
    by the annotator. The numbers reported as missing are actually missing in the
    PDF and the digital version is fine. The numbers reported as duplicate are also
    fine (the second number is actually a combination of a number plus a letter).
    However, some pages are partly missing: PageV01P366-368, PageV03P250,
    PageV04P165, PageV04P171. 3- Find a different edition here:
