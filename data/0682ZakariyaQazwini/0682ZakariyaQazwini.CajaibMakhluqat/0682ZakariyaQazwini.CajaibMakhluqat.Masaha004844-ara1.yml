90#VERS#COMMENT##: Structure tagged and indices deleted. I could not locate a
    PDF of the exact edition (see metadata in the file) online, so I have used the
    one on archive.org as a reference, and tagged the text largely based on evident
    textual structure. The text of these editions seems to be largely the same,
    except for some divergences in paragraphs and headers (which are not numbered in
    the PDF), some differences in wording, and the non-inclusion of tables in the
    digital text (compare for example p. 71 in the PDF vs. p. 74 in digital text,
    the jadwal of months is not included). The digital text was pre-tagged but
    without hierarchy and also missed several headers that are marked in the edition
    I checked. These are actually useful for textual structure, so I have tagged
    them too. It would be possible to subdivide some of the sections even further,
    as they are long catalogues of islands, rivers, types of stones and so on. I
    have only done so where otherwise the structure of the text would become unclear
    (namely in the section on animals).
