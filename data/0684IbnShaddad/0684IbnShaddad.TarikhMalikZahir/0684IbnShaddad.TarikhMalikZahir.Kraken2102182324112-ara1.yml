 Annotator comments: text annotated and cleaned, but only superficially:
    footnotes removed, pagination implemented, poetry tagged and mistakes
    corrected
    when I saw them, but doubtlessly many typos remain. A common typo was lam-
    alif
    for a comma at the end of a line. Some lines failed entirely. I have typed
    these
    when I came across them but more may remain. Generally quality seemed to be
    fairly good though. Only half of the book survives, so I have added two
    empty
    headers above the first header, so that the structure is consistent across
    the
    digital text(first level for years, second level for events and obituaries
    respectively, and third header for individual events -- this changes at the
    end
    where a sort of appendix is added to the text which follows a different
    format.
    Note that this is not editorial, the manuscript contains the same appendix
    and
    it was clearly compiled as such by the author).
