90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: SPL (CnC)
90#VERS#COMMENT##: The digital edition included two commentaries:
    Ibn Shatt (d. 0723) and Husayn Malikiyya (d. 1425). 
    These have been removed and separate files created.
    Cleaned random chars in the text.
    The text is largely continuous but 'قاعدة' is used
    as an introduction to some qāʿidas.
    Also al-qāʿida + ordinal number (e.g., القاعدة الثالثة).
    Very little punctuation, etc.
    Overall very good correspondence.
