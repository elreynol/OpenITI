90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: Text appears to be of good quality, pagination is correct.
    Editorial introduction, editorial additions, and most footnote markers deleted.
    Poetry tagged. Manuscript folio markers are still largely present but can
    probably easily be deleted with a regex.
 From the third volume onwards the text's structure changes into a more overtly
    annalistic structure (or at least, in the preceding volumes the changes in years
    were not rendered as headers), so from that point onwards there is a three level
    hierarchy (for the preceding volumes, omit level 1): 1 - years, 2 - events, 3 -
    either a specification of events, or a "sira" of deceased sultans (a sort of
    obituary).
 Some headers were broken up on two or more lines. I have corrected most of
    these to rended on one line, but may have missed some.
    NB: check lines of poetry that seem too short: line numbers 4269
