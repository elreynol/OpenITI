90#VERS#COMMENT##: The auto-tagging was not entirely succesful in this text,
    needed significant cleaning up. I have done so with regex, but the easiest
    way
    to do it resulted in not all names being confined to one line. A lot of them
    are
    still on two or more lines and sometimes spread over pages (as is the case
    in
    the edition), which perhaps needs to be addressed later on.
 I deleted editorial sections and footnote markers, tagged poetry (there were a
    handful of cases of overtagging, i.e. of non-poetry being tagged, which I
    have
    deleted, but some may remain). Pagination appears to be correct, though I
    had to
    change every PageV06 to PageV05 (volume 6 is made up of indices that are not
    part of the digital text). There are quite a few empty biographies, these
    are
    also empty in the edition.
    NB: check lines of poetry that seem too short: line numbers 3968, 4767,
    8426, 9721, 10707, 12308, 14354, 18164, 18310, 18371, 18808, 20047, 21332,
