90#VERS#COMMENT##: OCRed through Kraken:
    * Kraken version: 3.0.0.0b21.dev6
    * segmentation model: DEFAULT
    * OCR model: 12-24-2021_ArabPersGeneralized.mlmodel
    
    Corrected by Gowaart. Collated link is the MS of the text. Footnotes removed,
    text annotated, poetry tagged. Structure of the text is not quite clear, it's
    mostly annalistic, but there are a few headers for sections as well, I have
    tagged the years as first level and other sections as second level. Here and
    there a few lines were not digitised, so I have typed them where I spotted them.
    Similarly, I have corrected mistakes where I saw them, but doutblessly several
    remain, especially as the PDF quality available for OCR was not of the highest
    possible quality. Generally speaking the OCR results are quite good though.
