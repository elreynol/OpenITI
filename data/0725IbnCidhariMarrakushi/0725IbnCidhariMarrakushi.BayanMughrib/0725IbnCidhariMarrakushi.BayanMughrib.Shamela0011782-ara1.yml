90#VERS#COMMENT##: no scanned copy is available for this edition.
    However the following e-copy follows is based on this edition https://m.
    marefa.org/images/7/7f/كتاب_البيان_المُغْرِب_في_أخبار_الأندلس_والمغرب.pd
    f. the text is based on Provencal/Colin's 1948 Leidben
    edition; generally free from typos and clean; minor discrepancies such
    as [ibn] in the text and [bin] in the printed edition.
    NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): I found the PDF and changed the VERS#LINKS#### and
    collated the text with it and made some changes. 2. Our digital version is just
    the first two volumes and volumes three and four are completely missing. So, I
    raised a ‘Text Quality’ issue for this and did not change the extension to
    mARkdown. Besides, PageV01P024-33 are missing as well. 3. It seems to me that
    some of the headers can be levelled. However, the text should be read carefully
    for this and this should be done by a specialist. 4. A different edition is
    accessible here: https://archive.org/details/FP144597/00_144597/mode/1up
