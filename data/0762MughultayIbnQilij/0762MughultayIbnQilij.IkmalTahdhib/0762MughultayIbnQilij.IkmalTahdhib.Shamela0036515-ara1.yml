    NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH):
    1- As the editor writes, the original manuscript
    is incomplete and does not include the parts for women’s biographies and
    Kunyas
    (See vol 12, page 394 in the PDF).
    2- The numbers of name entries checked and corrected through Peter’s script.
    PV inserted the biographies that were dropped from the edition
    (from al-Ḥasan al-Baṣrī to al-Ḥakam b. Sinān, p. PageV04P091)
    and edited later by a number of students from King Saud university
    (Shamela0037551, http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/4770566859,
    https://archive.org/details/TarajumSaqitaMinIqmalTahthib/mode/2up).
    The volume number for these inserted pages is "A1"
    (PageVA1P047-PageVA1P270).
    PV also removed the remaining HTML tags.
