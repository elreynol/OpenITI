90#VERS#COMMENT##: Pages V2: 343-382 were missing but have now been replaced
    with OCR'd text.
    Some qāʿidas are introduced as part of the title,
    such as the doubt canon, القاعدة الأولى: اليقين لا يرفع بالشك.
    These are then followed by lengthy commentaries.
    Many introduced by 'qāʿida:'.
    Occasionally end of pages are out by a couple of lines.
    Additional page breaks have been removed.
    Hierarchy is somewhat unclear w/o close reading.
