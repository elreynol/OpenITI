90#VERS#COMMENT##: The text follows the printed edition closely,
    with only a few missing pages: 7:279, 8:48, 8:303-304, 9:331, 10:262-263.
    Additionally, a missing section on page 3:400;
    the numbers 6-19 which appear in the middle of the text
    replace a few paragraphs of writing in the printed edition.
    SPL replaced the missing pages except 10:262-263,
    which are poetry and thus did not OCR very well
    (an ongoing problem with the model).
    As poetry is unlikely to be a focus of CnC research, this was deemed acceptable.
