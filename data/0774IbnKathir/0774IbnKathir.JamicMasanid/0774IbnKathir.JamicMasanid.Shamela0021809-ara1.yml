90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: PV
90#VERS#COMMENT##: PV improved the hierarchy of the digitized file by
    * assigning the section on each letter to level 1
    * assigning the first-level alphabetically listed authors to level 2
    * assigning the transmitters related to those authors to level 3
    * assigning the numbered paragraphs to level 4
    NB: even if no level 3 authors are present, numbered paragraphs are level 4
    NB: in some entries, there seems to be another level below level 3
        (often introduced with "ḥadīth ākhar"); these have been tagged level 3.
    PV added the missing header "Bāb al-kuná".
    Pagination is not fully implemented: PageV00P000 page numbers seem to
    indicate
    the location of the page breaks, while numbered page numbers are
    located at the end of the section that starts on that page.
    The paper edition contains two additional volumes, not digitized here,
    containing sections on the following transmitters
    (both missing from vols. 1-10):
    vol. 11: section on ʿAbd Allāh b. ʿAbbās
    vol. 12: section on Abū Saʿīd al-Khudrī
    (it is not 100% clear from the introductions of vols. 11-12
    if these sections were originally part of the Jāmiʿ al-Masānīd)
    NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): I did not change anything in this text after a
    discussion with the annotator. See the discussion in the “text tagged” issue of
    Shamela0021809.
