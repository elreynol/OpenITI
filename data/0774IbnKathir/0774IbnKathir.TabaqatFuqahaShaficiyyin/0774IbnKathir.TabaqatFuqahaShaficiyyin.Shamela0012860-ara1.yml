90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: MGR
90#VERS#COMMENT##: Some biographies are not tagged still (919 out
    of 958 [but in a different edition]); also, the order of biographies is
    messed up --- they all seem to be there, but shuffled. Paper edition
    itself is incredibly messy.
    NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): As the annotator mentions, the digital version
    has a lot of differences with the printed version, although they are exactly
    the
    same edition. I found out that this is because the typist has typed the text
    based on the printed version, but at the same time has collated the text
    with a
    newer edition of the text ( Dār-al-kutub al-ʿilmiyyaŧ, 2018:
    https://books.google.com/books?id=Lz1ZDwAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PP1)
    and has added some parts based on this edition. This is the reason why the
    text
    of the digital version has a lot of differences with the PDF. Besides, the
    introduction of the author and the biography of al-Imām al-Šāfiʿī at the
    beginning of the text has entered from this newer edition into the digital
    version with unnumbered pages, and does not exist in the PDF (However, the
    first
    part of the PDF, beginning with PageV01P003 might be an incomplete version
    of
    this part based on an incomplete manuscript which is duplicated here. I’m
    not
    sure about this. Someone must carefully read and collate the two parts to
    make
    sure about this). 2- A third edition of the text is accessible here:
