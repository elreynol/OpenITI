90#VERS#COMMENT##: JK and Shamela versions are the same text, I picked the
    Shamela version as it already had some tagging in place. Unclear which edition
    was used for this, so I have annotated based on the edition found on archive.org
    (this is also the one noted in "collated" above). It's likely that this is not
    the same edition however, as the pagination is different (however, note that
    pages seem unusually long in the digital editions). As the text matches and the
    textual structure is rather easy to follow, I have annotated on textual logic,
    as also outlined in the introduction. However, the text quality is not super
    high, I came across quite a lot of typos. I have corrected some when I saw them.
    On the last 2 pages the long final poem of the text has not been preserved in
    full: after the first two lines only the first half of each line is included
    here, the rest is missing (also in the JK version).
