90#VERS#COMMENT##: PV did not find the exact edition from which JK011690
    was digitized. The edition used for collation contains multiple texts,
    of which only two are in the JK edition:
    * 0593BurhanDinFarghaniMarghinani.HidayaFiSharhBidaya,
    in the upper part of the central page
    (inside the box, above the horizontal line)
    * 0786IbnMuhammadBabarti.CinayaSharhHidaya,
    in the upper part of the margin
    (outside the box, above the horizontal line)
    PV split the two texts into separate files.
    NB: the two texts were much easier to disentangle in the Shamela file,
    which had remnants of the html tags in the text.
    In the JK version, the beginning of each section containing text of the ʿInāya
    was marked with "S", while the end of each section containing text of the Hidāya
    was marked with "." (the latter not always consistently).
    PV split the two texts using regular expressions and manual checks,
    but it is probably better to use the Shamela version of the text.
    NB: the digital text seems to be missing the last section of the commentary
    (https://archive.org/details/waq14418 : vol. 8 pp. 514-515)
