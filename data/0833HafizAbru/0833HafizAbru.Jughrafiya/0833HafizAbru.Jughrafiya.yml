90#BOOK#COMMENT##: Sezgin, Geschichte des arabischen Schrifttums 14.305f.:
    "It came into existence in the year 817/1414, when he translated 
    an Arabic book with the title Masālik al-mamālik wa-ṣuwar al-aqālīm
    into Persian and expanded it, on behalf of [Timur's son] Šāhrukh.
    Apparently, the original belonged to the classical Balkhī school of
    Arabo-Islamic geography. The book, which remained incomplete, 
    carries the title Tārīkh, which probably does not stem from the author
    himself but was given by another hand. (...) Even though Ḥāfiẓ-i Abru
    based himself mostly on an old Masālik wa-al-mamālik book of the Balkhī
    school, he was of course not able to get away from the developments in
    between. (...) His description of [Khurāsān] can be considered unique 
    in its detailed approach to the division into provinces and districts
    with the villages and hamlets that belong to them. (...) Ḥāfiẓ-i Abru 
    took over the maps of the Balkhī school with limited changes."
