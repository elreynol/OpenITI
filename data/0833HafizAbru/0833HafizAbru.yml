90#AUTH#COMMENT##: Sezgin, Geschichte des arabischen Schrifttums 14.305:
    "Ḥāfiẓ-i Abrū, from Herat, apparently grew up in Hamadan.
    Very little is known about his life's circumstances.
    As can be discerned from his own statements, he was known 
    as a chess master and was in the service of Timur and his son Shārukh.
    He has reported as an eye witness about the latter's campaigns.
    He died in 833/1430 in Zanjān."
