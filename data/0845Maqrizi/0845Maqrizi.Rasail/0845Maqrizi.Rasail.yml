90#BOOK#COMMENT##: MB: "The one collection of Rasail that we have in the corpus 
    is allegedly based on a microfilm of a manuscript in the BNF Paris (4657). 
    The manuscript with that shelfmark in the BNF digital collections does not, 
    however, correspond exactly to the edition (it shares some rasa'il and adds 
    many more, including short texts which probably aren't formally rasa'il). 
    I cannot easily find a manuscript that actually corresponds to the edition we have, 
    but if we are to trust the editor, it has been produced from a microfilmed 
    collection of rasa'il that were written by al-Maqrizi. 
    In short, at some point these rasa'il were collected together into one codex, 
    but it's not clear when.
    The Rasa'il, however, evidently circulated separately and were recompiled 
    in different orders. There is a second manuscript in Leiden (or. 560), 
    which contains Rasa'il that correspond to those found in both the printed 
    edition and the Paris manuscript that I could find. 
    Interestingly, the Risala that I compared had additional material in places 
    (sometimes a few words, sometimes whole sentences), so the Rasa'il must have 
    changed as they circulated as well. 
    According to Bauden, Leiden or. 560 was copied at the request of al-Maqrizi 
    and the manuscript is contemporary to him 
    (https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22230293-al-maqr-z-s-collection-of-opuscules - unfortunately the blurb is all I can get for this info, as the book has STILL not been published). This means al-Maqrizi himself had envisioned that these Rasa'il should be bundled together into collections.
    I would say that we keep the collection of Rasa'il together in the corpus, 
    as it seems to represent a collection that existed at some point 
    (when and at whose behest, given I can't find the actual manuscript, we cannot say).
    I would argue that we should work towards digitising the other two manuscripts
    in the future and adding them to the corpus as whole collections.
    We could use that to tackle this question more fully.
    (On this it's worth noting that Jo van Steenbergen's edition of the 
    al-Dhahab al-Masbuk, now in the corpus, actually belongs within the 
    Leiden manuscript, and Bauden is working with other scholars to edit 
    and publish other texts from within that manuscript.)"
