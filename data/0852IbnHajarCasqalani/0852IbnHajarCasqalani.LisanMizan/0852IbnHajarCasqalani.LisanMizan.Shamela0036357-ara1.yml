90#VERS#COMMENT##: Publisher is wrongly detailed as Dar al-Basha'ir al-
    Islamiyya in the metadata. The actual publisher is Maktab al-Matbu'at
    al-Islamiyya. The text is extremely long, amounting to over 10 volumes.
    As such, textual correspondence has only been checked on a number of
    select pages throughout the work. The numbering of biographical entries
    appears consistent w/ the printed edition. Pagination failed; there are
    also some other embedded pages numbers in square brackets (generally odd
    only), but these are also not consistent w/ the printed edition, and
    should probably be removed.
    NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): A few untagged headers tagged. The levelling of a
    few headers changed. Women’s biographies tagged. 2- From PageV09P248 onwards, a
    repeated long part appears after each entry (like footnotes, after === sign)
    which does not exist in the PDF, and should be removed. 3- The main point about
    this text is that the whole of the nineth volume is PARATEXT. I just added the
    PARATEXT tag at the beginning of this volume, and kept the rest of the tags for
    this volume. It seems that the scribe has extended and completed the short list
    of laqabs and nasabs that had already been produced by the original author. So,
    this part has actually two authors. Some of the entries in this part are for the
    original author and some others are for the scribe. The original author has
    inserted information for some of the entries, and therefore this part is
    actually more than a mere list of cross-references, and contains original
    information. So, I think it’s essential to keep this part and its tags. 4- About
    the numbering system of the entries, see the editor’s introduction (vol 1, page
    148).
