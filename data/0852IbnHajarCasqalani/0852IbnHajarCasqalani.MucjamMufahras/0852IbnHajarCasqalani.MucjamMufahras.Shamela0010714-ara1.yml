90#VERS#COMMENT##: The titles are a line below the tag. The majority of
    semantic units are book entries, which are currently tagged as ## $.
    There is one section that includes actual biographical entries (Chapter
    5). Correspondence is good with no obvious errors.
    NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): One title added in square brackets in page 129.
    PARATEXT added. 2- A part of page 104 is missing. 3- I donâ€™t see the
    biographical entries mentioned by the annotator (the text is a bibliographical
    dictionary).
