90#VERS#COMMENT##: Commentary on Sahih al-Bukhari.Â  Good correspondence
    w/ printed edition.  The autotagging had tagged many subsections that
    refer to the chapters of the original work.  While these are not
    hierarchical markers per se, I have kept (and checked most of them)  as
    they are useful for navigation and cross-referencing w/ the original
    work.  It also seemed counterintuitive to remove them.  Occasionally,
    page dividers out by a couple of lines (e.g. v3: 184/5).
   NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): I agree with the annotator about keeping the second-level auto-tagged headers. I realized that there are more cases that have not been taken by the auto-tagging. So, I found and tagged more cases of this kind by RegEx. However, the text probably needs to be read closely by a specialist since there might still be more cases. 2- A few untagged first-level headers tagged, and subsequent levelling changed accordingly.
