    and a full edition has not yet been produced. 
    Currently existing partial editions:
    * years 431-520: ed. Shayea Abd al-Hadi al-Hajeri, A Critical Edition of the Eleventh Volume of ʿIqd al-jumān, unpublished PhD thesis, University of Edinburgh 2007 (https://era.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/7525).

    * years 815-850: ed. Qarmūṭ, Cairo 1985-1989 (in OpenITI as MMS00021-ara2)
    According to Nobutaka Nakamachi, Shukrī's edition is a conflation of the ʿIqd al-Jumān with al-ʿAynī's Tārīkh al-badr;
    the editions of al-Hajeri, Maḥmūd, Amīn and Qarmūṭ are all reliable editions of parts of the ʿIqd al-Jumān.
    See Nobutaka Nakamachi, "A Historiographical Analysis 
    of the Four Chronicles Attributed to Badr al-Dīn al-ʿAynī", in
    Stephan Conerman and Toru Miura eds., 
    Studies on the History and Culture of the Mamluk Sultanate (1250-1517),
    Göttingen 2021: 113-138 (esp. pp. 116-117, 125).
    The Amīn and Qarmūṭ editions have been merged together in OpenITI
