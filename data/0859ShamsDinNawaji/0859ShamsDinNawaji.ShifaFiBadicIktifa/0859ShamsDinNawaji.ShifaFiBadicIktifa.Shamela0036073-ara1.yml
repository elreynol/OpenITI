90#VERS#COMMENT##: Text appears to be of fairly good quality. I tagged the
    poetry. The edition has blank pages between the various sections, hence why
    page
    numbers seem to be missing. Quranic verses and hadiths have been rendered
    between round brackets. I have left these in.
    NB: check lines of poetry that seem too short: line numbers 511, 682
    NB: check lines of poetry that seem too long: line numbers 419, 601, 625
