90#VERS#COMMENT##: Zaydiyya0000275 is a digitization of (a pirated
    edition of?)  ʿAlī Yaḥyā al-Yamānī's edition of the Sharḥ al-Azhār
    (Cairo 1332: Maṭbaʿat Sharikat al-Tamaddun), not including its long
    introduction containing al-Jundārī's Tarājim, nor the footnotes and
    ḥawāshī.  Vol. 3 includes another text related to the Sharḥ al-Azhār,
    al-Ḥīmī's Tabṣira.  PV split off that work into a separate text file. PV
    also removed the ḥawāshī in the footnotes, which, according to the title
    page, came from a manuscript (dated 1207 AH) that was copied (including
    the ḥawāshī)  from a manuscript of and read to Shaykh al-Islām al-qāḍī
    al-ʿallāma  Muḥammad b. ʿAlī al-Shawkānī.
    NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): All the headers were mixed with the body text. I
    tried to separate them. However, the printed version has a very bad quality and
    it is not clear where the body text begins. So, I did this based on my
    understanding of the text, and most probably I have made a few mistakes in it.
    Most of the headers are just fasl without further explanation to say about what
    it is. Sometimes it is possible to tag the first short sentence in the body text
    as the header to clarify this. In other cases, explanation should be added in
    square brackets by a specialist in Fiqh. In some cases, page numbers were in the
    middle of the headers. I moved them to the end of the headers. There were also
    third-level headers that appeared after first-level headers. I changed their
    levelling to second-level.
