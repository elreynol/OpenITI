   NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): The alphabetical order of names in the text does
    not continue after Muhammad; however, this is not a problem in the digital text.
    The rest of the text might be missing in the original manuscript since the PDF
    ends at this point as well. 2- Pagination problems reported by the annotator are
    actually problems in the pagination of the PDF. The pagination of the digital
    text is correct.
