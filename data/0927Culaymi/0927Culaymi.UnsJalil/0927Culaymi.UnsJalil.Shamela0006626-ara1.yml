90#VERS#COMMENT##: Minor textual differences, often with honourific
    qualifications added (e.g., dhikr qissat Ibrahim, vs. dhikr saydina Ibrahim in
    digital). Pagination is totally out both in terms of numbers but also page
    breaks. Multiple parts are totally out of place. For example the 'Story of the
    building of the Ka'ba' should follow the story of Moses' exodus, but in the
    digital edition precedes it is and is found within a series of sections on God's
    creation. A new edition needs to be found.
