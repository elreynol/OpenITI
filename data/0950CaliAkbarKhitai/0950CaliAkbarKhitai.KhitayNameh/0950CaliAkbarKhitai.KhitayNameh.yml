90#BOOK#COMMENT##: Sezgin, Geschichte des arabischen Schrifttums 14.309,
    citing Paul Kahle:
    "The work is not a travelogue in the real sense, but it contains
    a systematic description of the conditions in China, in 20 chapters.
    (...) a very valuable, large source
    about Ming-Dynasty China, especially about the time of the accession of
    emperor Ch'êng-tî around the year 1506, a time about which we otherwise
    know almost nothing from non-Chinese sources; a source that should be
    taken seriously and that significantly enhances our knowledge about this
    period."
