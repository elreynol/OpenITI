    Sezgin, Geschichte des arabischen Schrifttums 14.311:
    "Based on a number of Arabic sources he had knowledge of or access to,
    the author tried to give a synoptic geographical description of the old world,
    and to enrich it with knowledge about the newly discovered parts of the earth
    (yeni dünya). For the sake of the latter, he seems to be using translations
    of Italian sources."
