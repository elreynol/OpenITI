90#BOOK#COMMENT##: A history of the rule of the Moghul ruler Akbar.
    Sezgin, Geschichte des arabischen Schrifttums 14.314:
    "The work relates to Akbar's 46-year long rule and that of his predecessors.
    It consists of three parts, of which the third has an anthropo-geographical
    character, in the real sense of the word, and carries an independent title: 
    Ā'īn-nāmeh. (...) The Ā'īn-nāmeh consists of five parts: 
    The first treats the personality of the king, the image one should have of him,
    his residence and his court. 
    The seconde treats the military and civilian functionaries, the literators
    and musicians working at the court.
    The third treats the juridical-administrative rules, institutions of a new,  
    practical era, in addition to the size of the Earth, classfication of the population
    and description of the State's income.
    The fourth treats the social relations among Hindus, their philosophy and law;
    in addition to invaders of and travelers to India, some exemplary Islamic pious men,
    and the sects they adhere to.
    The fifth treats moral sayings, epigrams, observations and regulations of the king."
