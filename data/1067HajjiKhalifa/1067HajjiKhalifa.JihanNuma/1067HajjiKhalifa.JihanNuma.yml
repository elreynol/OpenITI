90#BOOK#COMMENT##: Geographical work, with a difficult history (see Sezgin GAS 14.318ff.):
    1st recension: started in 1058/1648 but not completed. "The four elements form
      the foundational principle of its division... The author has only implemented
      parts of the third chapter, which treats water, and in which he describes the 
      seas, rivers and lakes known to the medieval geographers; and parts of the fourth chapter,
      on the earth, in which countries and cities should be described... and a part of the 
      real description of the countries: 1. Muslim Spain, 2. North Africa (both only based on
      the Arab geographers), and 3. Turkey". 
    2nd recension: started in 1064/1653, after he had translated (part of) Mercator's Atlas Minor;
      this recension also remained incomplete. 
      "Ḥajjī Khalīfa made the continents the foundation of the division of this new version.
      He starts with East Asia (Japan) and ends in East Anatolia at the city Van."
      Ḥajjī Khalīfa's text ends on p. 421 of the Müteferrika edition, but it is not clear
      which parts Müteferrika himself inserted into Ḥajjī Khalīfa's text, nor who 
      wrote the continuation (pp. 421-698).
