90#VERS#COMMENT##: In volume 2, from page 50 to 95, all the biographical tags
    that have asterisks (### $ *) are a subsection (actually the teachers) of the
    previous biographical tag. I showed them by an asterisk so that they are
    distinguishable from the other names that are sorted alphabetically. Besides,
    this part needs some headers. I showed the place of the needed headers with
    “#:section:”. The headers must be added by a specialist in front of my blank
    tags (using the table of contents at the end of the book) to make the
    categorization of this part more accurate. 2- In volume 3, I see a few pages in
    which the footnotes are interred into the text without any footnote marker (see
    Page 271 and 280 for example).
