90#BOOK#COMMENT##: Description of the text by P. Elie Saade
    "It's a 13-pages archive of 170x110mm dimensions that holds the cote
    STM_4. Created and written by Priest Stephan the 2nd, son of Priest
    Stephan the 1st (born in 1855 and deceased 27 August 1938 : Review
    STM_15 ff.38)
    It appears that the date of redaction of this arabic prose zajaliya
    (similar to folk poetry) goes back to 1919 because the author mentions
    in its end the travel of the maronite patriarch Elias Hoyek to France to
    attend the Paris Peace Conference, praying for his safe return to his
    residence at Bkerke, knowing that the Patriarch's trip was between 15
    July and 17 December 1919.
    The identity of the author was elucidates from his granddaughter,
    Miss Josephine Ibrahim El-Khoury (1912-1989) in one of her diaries where
    she mentions that a prose written by Priest Stephan the 2nd, son of
    Priest Stephan the 1st, was written during WWI, and that it describes
    the Lebanese people living under these difficult days.
    The archive was discovered by me father Elie Saade during my service
    at Saint Michael church in Al-Douk -Batroun(North lebanon) in 2011.
    I and Tony Haykal,  worked together to read it and decipher its
    meanings.
    We publish this prose for the first time as a tribute for the people
    of Al-Douk known for their mastery of litterary poetry and as a tribute
    for the blood of our Lebanese martyrs who passed away during WWI,
    specially due to the famine that happened in Lebanon.
