90#VERS#COMMENT##: The original text file contained the main text and Khumaynī's
    taʿlīqa.
    PV split the main text off from the taʿlīqa and marked
    Khumaynī's quotations as second-level headings.
    Perhaps it would be useful to add the first-level headings from the original
    text?
    PV also removed the remaining page headers that had become included in the text.
