90#VERS#COMMENT##: I used the second edition of the book for collation which is very different from the first edition used in the digital version. 2- Most of the biographical tags have subsections. I showed them by “#~:section:”. 3- The “مدخل” at the end of the book is to explain about the genealogy of the author (i.e. his great grandfather, “محمد بن عبد الوهاب”, and his descendants). I tagged this part as editorial.
